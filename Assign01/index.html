<h1>Hannah Arnett</h1>
<p>Hey there! Welcome to my page. I am a sophomore in Web Programming and Design. I also have a minor in Design and Innovation, and I am
completing the Entrepreneurship and Innovation certificate. My passion in life is combining logic and reasoning with creative design. In the future,
I would love to focus on human-centered digital marketing. As in, I would love to study how humans interact with designs and tailor my digital marketing
projects to the results. As with many others, working at Google (or a company comparable to it) is my ultimate career goal, but I also would like to start
my own company at some point in my life.</p>
<p>As a sophomore, I have bountiful experience in HTML and CSS. I started learning web programming in my junior year of high school and competed
in fundamentals of web design two years in a row at the local and state level. At Purdue, I have two student web developer jobs on campus that I've worked 
since the summer semester of my freshman year. It is very exciting to further my knowlege of web development such as learning Javascript and other languages!
I look forward to learning in this class!</p>
